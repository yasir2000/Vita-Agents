# Security Policy

## üîí Our Commitment

Vita Agents is committed to ensuring the security and privacy of healthcare data. As a healthcare interoperability platform, we take security seriously and follow industry best practices to protect patient health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII).

## üè• Healthcare Security Context

### HIPAA Compliance
- We design our systems to support HIPAA-compliant deployments
- PHI handling follows minimum necessary standards
- Audit logging is implemented for all data access
- Access controls are enforced at multiple levels

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is processed
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all operations

## üõ°Ô∏è Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          | End of Support |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| 2.1.x   | ‚úÖ Current         | -              |
| 2.0.x   | ‚úÖ LTS             | 2025-06-01     |
| 1.x.x   | ‚ùå End of Life     | 2024-01-01     |

### Support Policy
- **Current**: Latest major version receives all security updates
- **LTS (Long Term Support)**: Previous major version receives critical security updates
- **End of Life**: No security updates provided

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly
3. **DO** report privately to our security team

### How to Report

#### Primary Method: Security Advisory
Create a private security advisory on GitHub:
1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/yasir2000/Vita-Agents/security)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form

#### Alternative Method: Email
Send details to: **security@vita-agents.org**

Include in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if any)
- Your contact information

### Healthcare-Specific Vulnerabilities

For vulnerabilities that could affect patient data or clinical workflows:
- Mark as "Healthcare Critical" in your report
- Include potential clinical impact assessment
- Specify affected healthcare standards (FHIR, HL7, etc.)
- Note any compliance implications (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)

## üìã Vulnerability Assessment Criteria

### Severity Levels

We use a modified CVSS scoring system with healthcare-specific considerations:

#### Critical (9.0-10.0)
- Unauthorized access to PHI/PII
- Remote code execution without authentication
- Complete system compromise
- Clinical workflow disruption affecting patient safety

#### High (7.0-8.9)
- Unauthorized access to system data
- Privilege escalation to admin level
- Data corruption or loss
- Significant clinical workflow disruption

#### Medium (4.0-6.9)
- Limited unauthorized data access
- Denial of service attacks
- Information disclosure
- Minor clinical workflow impact

#### Low (0.1-3.9)
- Limited information disclosure
- Minor configuration issues
- Non-critical functionality impact

### Healthcare Impact Assessment

Additional factors for healthcare environments:
- **Patient Safety Impact**: Does it affect clinical decisions?
- **Data Sensitivity**: PHI vs. non-sensitive data
- **Regulatory Impact**: HIPAA, FDA, or other compliance issues
- **Clinical Workflow**: Impact on healthcare operations
- **Interoperability**: Effect on healthcare data exchange
