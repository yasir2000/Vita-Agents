## CLI Commands

### Agent Management
```bash
# Initialize default healthcare agents
python enhanced_cli.py agents init

# List all registered agents
python enhanced_cli.py agents list

# Show detailed agent capabilities
python enhanced_cli.py agents capabilities

# Show workflow status
python enhanced_cli.py agents status
```

### Clinical Operations
```bash
# Collaborative diagnosis
python enhanced_cli.py agents diagnose \
  --age 45 \
  --gender male \
  --complaint "chest pain" \
  --history "hypertension,diabetes" \
  --medications "metformin,lisinopril" \
  --severity urgent

# Medication review
python enhanced_cli.py agents medication-review \
  --age 65 \
  --gender female \
  --medications "warfarin,aspirin,metoprolol" \
  --allergies "penicillin" \
  --new-med "ibuprofen"

# Multi-agent workflow demonstration
python enhanced_cli.py agents workflow
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Collaborative Diagnosis
```bash
python enhanced_cli.py agents diagnose \
  --age 55 \
  --gender female \
  --complaint "fatigue and weight gain" \
  --history "hypothyroidism" \
  --medications "levothyroxine" \
  --severity routine
```

This command:
1. Creates a patient context with the provided information
2. Assigns the diagnosis task to the most suitable agent (Diagnostician)
3. Executes the clinical reasoning using the active LLM
4. Returns structured diagnostic recommendations with confidence scores

### 2. Medication Safety Review
```bash
python enhanced_cli.py agents medication-review \
  --age 70 \
  --gender male \
  --medications "warfarin 5mg daily,metformin 1000mg BID,lisinopril 10mg daily" \
  --allergies "sulfa drugs" \
  --new-med "ciprofloxacin"
```

This command:
1. Analyzes current medications for interactions
2. Checks for allergy contraindications
3. Evaluates the safety of adding the new medication
4. Provides evidence-based recommendations

### 3. Multi-Agent Workflow
The workflow demo showcases how multiple agents collaborate on a complex case:
1. **Diagnostician** performs initial assessment
2. **Pharmacist** reviews medications for optimization
3. **Care Coordinator** manages the overall care plan

## Technical Implementation

### Agent Architecture
```python
class HealthcareAgent(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    role: HealthcareRole
    specialties: List[str]
    capabilities: Dict[str, HealthcareCapability]
    current_tasks: List[str]
    completed_tasks: List[str]
    performance_metrics: Dict[str, float]
```

### Task Assignment Algorithm
1. **Role Compatibility Check**: Verify agent's role matches task requirements
2. **Capability Assessment**: Ensure agent has required capabilities with sufficient proficiency
3. **Workload Analysis**: Check agent's current task capacity
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Calculate agent's confidence for the specific task
5. **Optimal Selection**: Choose the best-suited agent

### Performance Metrics
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successfully completed tasks
- **Task Distribution**: Count of tasks by type for each agent
- **Confidence Tracking**: Average confidence scores across tasks
- **Experience Level**: Total tasks completed and learning progression

## Integration with LLM System

The framework seamlessly integrates with the existing LLM system:
- Uses the active LLM model configured in `llm_integration.py`
- Supports all available models (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Optimizes prompts for clinical accuracy with lower temperature settings
- Provides structured clinical outputs with confidence scoring

## Extension Points

### Adding New Agent Types
```python
# Define new healthcare role
class HealthcareRole(Enum):
    RADIOLOGIST = "radiologist"
    CARDIOLOGIST = "cardiologist"
    # ... add more roles

# Create specialized agent
radiologist = HealthcareAgent(
    name="RadioBot",
    role=HealthcareRole.RADIOLOGIST,
    specialties=["Medical Imaging", "Radiology"],
    capabilities={
        "image_interpretation": HealthcareCapability("image_interpretation", "Radiology", 0.95),
        "anatomical_knowledge": HealthcareCapability("anatomical_knowledge", "Anatomy", 0.90)
    }
)
```

### Adding New Task Types
```python
class ClinicalTaskType(Enum):
    SURGICAL_PLANNING = "surgical_planning"
    PATHOLOGY_REVIEW = "pathology_review"
    # ... add more task types
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Learning Capabilities**: Agents learn from successful cases and improve over time
2. **Knowledge Integration**: Integration with medical knowledge bases and guidelines
